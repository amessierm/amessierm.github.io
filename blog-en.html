                    <p>
                        Wooo! We're back from our epic cross-country skiing expedition between Kuujjuaq and Kangiqsualujjuaq (George River), Nunavik. In total, the expedition was 9 days, 155 kms. The route followed the snowmobile trail between the two villages, heading northeast. We started skiing from the Whale River, then crossed the Marralik, Tuttutuuq, Qurlutuq and finally George rivers. Mild temperatures the week before our departure had us worried about the river and lake conditions for our crossings. In the end, everything was good and frosty, and we enjoyed comfortable temperatures just below freezing, around -5°C.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our only weather-related problem occurred on days 1 and 2. A blizzard of wet snow hit us after only 10km of our crossing. We had to cut short our first real day of skiing to wait for the blizzard to pass and visibility to improve. Wet snow is perhaps worse than rain! Finally, on day 2, we were able to cover the distances required for our traverse. A total of around 150 km of skiing. We didn't come across anyone else until the sixth day of skiing!

                        Do we recommend it? Yes! Would we do it again? Certainly! And for even longer. Anyone with enough time could take a break once in George-River and continue on the Koroc River to get to the Torngats Park.

                        After a <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2048378/ours-polaire-nunavik-kuujjuaq" target="_blank"> polar bear</a> visited the village of Kuujjuaq this winter, we wanted to step up our bear precautions. We tried going out with a dog, but finally we opted for a fence (less food to lug around!) Arnaud built it with aluminum angles (fairly light) and trip-wire alarms. Installation was rather tedious at first, given the knotting fishing wire, but was refined by using wooden sticks to wind the ropes. After a few days of freezing rain the alarm mechanisms were coated with ice & Arnaud installed a makeshift raincoat with plastic bags to protect them. We were also glad he brought lock antifreeze to de-ice the mechanisms!

                        <p>For those interested here is the full transcript of our journal day by day : </p>
                            
                        <p class="indented-paragraph"><span class="bold-span">Day 0 - </span>the cavalry (our generous friends on skidoos) arrived just after noon to take us 60 kms northeast of Kuujjuaq to Whale River, our starting destination. We got in 5 kms of skiing before the sun started to set. </p>
                            
                        <p class="indented-paragraph"><span class="bold-span">Day 1 - </span>we woke up to a blizzard to freezing rain/wet snow. Off to a great start! As the blizzard conditions worsened, we decided to cut the day short after 6 kms. Sticky snow, strong winds and bad visibility forced us to walk instead of ski, while unable to see the trail ahead. We waited out the storm in our cozy tent drying all our gear that had been soaked by the wet snow.</p>

                        <p class="indented-paragraph"><span class="bold-span">Day 2 - </span>Hooray! We were able to make up for lost time from the day before with the sun SHINING! Great day of skiing, although heavy, wet sinking snow forced us to travel a little slower than we had hoped for. 20 kms traveled.</p>
            
                        <p class="indented-paragraph"><span class="bold-span">Day 3 - </span>Cold start & spilled coffee. We cruised on solid, icy snow, making our way to Marralik River, our first crossing. Lots of gatorade, ptarmigans, 1 fox, a nap & snacks in the sun made the day fly by. </p>

                        <p class="indented-paragraph"><span class="bold-span">Day 4 - </span>Foggy day with crusty snow, ups & downs & Tuttutuuq River crossing. We found the perfect camping spot just off the trail & in the trees, and spent the evening repairing literally everything. Praying for sun tomorrow!</p>
                        
                        <p class="indented-paragraph"><span class="bold-span">Day 5 -</span> 4 am JUMP START!! Two bear bangers set off by an unknown start, with no bear in sight- false alarm? Jamie reads some stories from Annie Mukluk & other stories (great book!) & we drift back off to bed. More skiing & skiing & skiing today! Bodies are getting tired & sore… travels over marshes, hills, lakes. Feels like we are in a black & white movie. Found a fishing outfitter with cabins & decided to stay the night. WOW! What a privilege not have to set up a tent. Halfway through the expedition & already feeling the expedition blues </p>
                    
                        <p class="indented-paragraph"><span class="bold-span"> Day 6 - </span>Snooze till 7 am in the luxury cabin with plush beds ;) pemmican & salty bambu for breakfast. Finally the sun made an appearance as we made it up some more hills. Bluebird lunch break with some awesome gliding in PARADISE :) Skied across hills, crossed lakes, crossed mountains, crossed more lakes. Stop for camp & Arnaud makes a great campfire. </p>
                        
                        <p class="indented-paragraph"><span class="bold-span">Day 7 - </span>Uphill start as we come across more mountainous terrains & come encounter the first people all trip! </p>
                        
                        <p class="indented-paragraph"><span class="bold-span">Day 8- </span>George River Crossing! Wake up at 5:30 am. Skidoos are flying by to go fishing. Departure in the fog as usual. Descent with a view on the George River.  Finally the mountains that Jamie wanted to see ! A freezing wind blows from the bay. How did we survive without the fur all this time ? Steep descent to the George and then traverse. Incredible views on the cliffs. Will we come back ? Yes this summer ! Nice arrival in town, we visit the sitik and the much expected polar bear ! A few Miss Vickies at the COOP and it’s done ! See you next year ! 11/10 ! Bravo !</p>

                    </div>


                    <p>You can also find our full winter packing list <a href="equipement.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Thinking about it, we wouldn't bring a speaker and a car booster pack for a battery pack (the thing discharged because the emergency light was on). We would have brought instead sightseeing glasses (Jamie's lol), some extra ski poles, a wash cloth, hair brush, a revolver (like Mike Horne, if only we could, lighter than a shotgun) an extra blue mat and a machette (if there's tree around on the next expedition).</p>

                    <p>
                        Also be sure to take a look at our <a href="winter-menu.html" target="_blank">winter expedition menu</a>.  Most meals were pre-cooked & dehydrated. Hot lunches were re-hydrated in soup thermos at breakfast.
                    </p>

                    <p>And that's a wrap folks ! Thanks for sticking around and see you next time !</p>
